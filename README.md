ii)	**Offline backup** – If the user does not have internet access, then the news that was previously fetched when the user was connected to internet will be displayed and when the user connects back to the internet, this “previously fetched news” will get updated in the backup file for future reference.

iii)	**Read News Feature** – This feature is responsible for reading the text which is displayed on the screen so that the person who is not able to read the news or does not want to read news can also listen the news.


iv)	**Read More functionality** – If the user clicks the read more button, then the user is directed to the site from which we have fetched the news. The news which is displayed on this app is small amount of data which is fetched from the site and if we click on “read more”, then it automatically opens the site from where we fetched the news. Hence, if the user is interested, then he/she can have a look at the details of the article.

•	Previous – It shows the previous news

•	Read More – It directs you to news site
